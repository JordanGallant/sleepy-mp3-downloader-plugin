# SoundCloud Downloader to MP3

## How it works

This project is a browser extension that injects a music downloader directly into your browser for **SoundCloud**, **Spotify**, and **Bandcamp**. It uses a Dockerized audio converter powered by `ffmpeg` to convert tracks to high-quality MP3 files at **320kbps** bitrate. The extension also supports **batch downloading** with ZIP file packaging and keeps a log of **recent downloads** for easy access.


Most MP3 downloaders are tedious to use and often return low-quality audio â€” this tool is designed to solve that.
